Challenge #2: Manager View (Next Level)

Create a new Node application called BamazonManager.js. Running this application will:

List a set of menu options: 
1) View Products for Sale 
2) View Low Inventory 
3) Add to Inventory 
4) Add New Product

If a manager selectis option 1 it should list all of the products available for sale: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.
If a manager selects option 2 it should list all items for which the quantity available in stores is less than 5.
If a manager selects option 3 it should provide the manager with the ability to "add more" of any item currently in the store.
If a manager selects option 4 it should provide the manager with the ability to add a completely new product to the store.
